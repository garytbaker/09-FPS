# 09-FPS
This is a repo for a project making a basic fps

You are stuck in a maze and have to find the blue ball.

Controls:
WASD to move
move the mouse to look around
space or left mouse click to interact with the blue ball. (Hold it down while character is touching it)

I made a model of a sign and it is right at the start of the game.
